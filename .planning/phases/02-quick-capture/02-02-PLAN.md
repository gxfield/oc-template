<objective>
Add Quick Capture reference to QUICKSTART.md and AGENTS.md so cheap LLMs know about natural language capture patterns from their first loaded documents.

Purpose: TOOLS.md now has full Quick Capture documentation (from Plan 01), but cheap LLMs may only load QUICKSTART.md due to context budget. This plan ensures the condensed reference also covers Quick Capture. Additionally, AGENTS.md startup checklist should mention Quick Capture so the LLM knows it's available.

Output: Updated QUICKSTART.md with Quick Capture section, updated AGENTS.md with Quick Capture mention.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add Quick Capture section to QUICKSTART.md</name>
  <files>QUICKSTART.md</files>
  <action>
Add a "## Quick Capture" section to QUICKSTART.md, placed AFTER the "## Meals" section and BEFORE the "## Response Style" section. This should be a condensed version of the TOOLS.md Quick Capture section.

Content to add (keep it tight -- QUICKSTART.md must stay under 100 lines total):

```
## Quick Capture

Natural language shortcuts -- no exact commands needed.

| User says | Target | Format |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| "remember X" / "note: X" / "don't forget X" | notes.md | `- [timestamp PT] X` |
| "we need X" / "add X to shopping" / "pick up X" | shopping.md | `- X` (capitalize) |
| "todo X" / "I need to X" | todos.md | `- [ ] X` |

- "remind me to X" (no time) = todo. "remind me at 3pm" = calendar event.
- "we need to fix Y" (verb) = todo. "we need eggs" (noun) = shopping.
- Multiple items: "eggs, bread, and butter" = 3 separate shopping lines.
```

This adds approximately 12 lines. Current QUICKSTART.md is 70 lines, so final will be ~82 lines (under 100 limit).

Ensure trigger phrases match exactly what was documented in TOOLS.md Quick Capture section (from Plan 01).
  </action>
  <verify>
1. QUICKSTART.md contains "## Quick Capture" heading
2. Trigger table has all three targets (notes, shopping, todos)
3. Disambiguation rules present (remind+time vs no-time, we-need+verb vs noun)
4. QUICKSTART.md is under 100 lines total (count with `wc -l`)
5. Trigger phrases match TOOLS.md Quick Capture section
  </verify>
  <done>
QUICKSTART.md has a Quick Capture section under 100 total lines with trigger table and disambiguation rules matching TOOLS.md.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update AGENTS.md startup checklist to mention Quick Capture</name>
  <files>AGENTS.md</files>
  <action>
In AGENTS.md, update Step 4 (Load tools reference) to mention Quick Capture availability:

Change the existing Step 4 text to add one line after the QUICKSTART.md tip:

```
- **Quick Capture:** Users can say "remember X", "we need X", or "todo X" for fast capture. See TOOLS.md Quick Capture section for full trigger list.
```

This is a single-line addition to the startup checklist so the LLM knows about Quick Capture from session start.

Do NOT restructure the existing Step 4 content. Just add the one line about Quick Capture.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. AGENTS.md Step 4 contains "Quick Capture" mention
2. Mentions "remember X", "we need X", "todo X" as examples
3. References TOOLS.md Quick Capture section
4. Rest of AGENTS.md unchanged
  </verify>
  <done>
AGENTS.md startup checklist Step 4 includes Quick Capture mention with example triggers and TOOLS.md reference.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

After both tasks complete:
1. QUICKSTART.md has Quick Capture section with trigger table
2. QUICKSTART.md is under 100 lines
3. AGENTS.md Step 4 mentions Quick Capture
4. Trigger phrases in QUICKSTART.md match TOOLS.md (from Plan 01)
5. A cheap LLM loading only QUICKSTART.md + AGENTS.md would know about all Quick Capture patterns
</verification>

<success_criteria>
A cheap LLM with minimal context (only QUICKSTART.md loaded) can:
1. Recognize "remember X" and know to add to notes.md with Pacific timestamp
2. Recognize "we need X" and know to add to shopping.md
3. Recognize "todo X" and know to add to todos.md
4. Know that "remind me at 3pm" is a calendar event, not a todo
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/02-quick-capture/02-02-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
