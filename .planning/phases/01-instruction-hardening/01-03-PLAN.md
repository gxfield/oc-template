<objective>
Create QUICKSTART.md as a single-page "do exactly this" reference that cheap LLMs can follow without needing to read TOOLS.md or AGENTS.md.

Purpose: Even with hardened TOOLS.md and AGENTS.md, a cheap LLM may not process long documents well. QUICKSTART.md is the "cheat sheet" -- the absolute minimum instructions to handle the 5 most common operations correctly. It repeats critical rules inline (timezone, file formats) so the LLM never needs to cross-reference. This is the file to load when context budget is tight.

Output: A new QUICKSTART.md at the workspace root, under 100 lines, covering calendar, todos, shopping, notes, and the critical timezone rule.

  <name>Task 1: Create QUICKSTART.md single-page reference</name>
  <files>QUICKSTART.md</files>
  <action>
Create a new file `QUICKSTART.md` at the workspace root. This must be a single-page, scannable reference that covers the most common operations. Read the updated TOOLS.md and AGENTS.md (from Plans 01 and 02) to ensure consistency, then create a condensed version.

Structure:

```markdown
# QUICKSTART - Household Assistant

Do exactly what this page says. No improvising.

## Rule #1: Timezone

You are in Pacific Time (America/Los_Angeles). The system clock is UTC.

- Get current time: `node calendar/calendar.js now`
- NEVER use `date` command (it returns UTC -- wrong after 4 PM Pacific)
- NEVER add "Z" or timezone suffix to event times
- All times shown to user must be Pacific with AM/PM

## Calendar

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Today's events | `node calendar/calendar.js today` |
| This week | `node calendar/calendar.js week` |
| Next N days | `node calendar/calendar.js upcoming N` |
| Current time | `node calendar/calendar.js now` |
| Add event | `node calendar/calendar.js add "Title" "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS" "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS"` |
| Add all-day | `node calendar/calendar.js add-allday "Title" "YYYY-MM-DD"` |
| Delete event | `node calendar/calendar.js delete EVENT_ID` |

"What's today" = `today` (NOT `list`)
"What's this week" = `week` (NOT `upcoming 7`)

## Todos (household/todos.md)

Format: `- [ ] Task` (incomplete) or `- [x] Task` (done)

- **Add:** Read file, append `- [ ] Task name`, write file back
- **Complete:** Read file, change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` on matching line, write file back
- **Show:** Read file, list incomplete items

## Shopping (household/shopping.md)

Format: `- Item name` (capitalize first letter)

- **Add:** Read file, append `- Item name`, write file back
- **Add multiple:** "eggs, bread, and butter" = three separate lines
- **Remove (bought):** Read file, delete matching line, write file back

## Notes (household/notes.md)

Format: `- [YYYY-MM-DD h:mm AM/PM PT] Note text`

- **Add:** Get time from `node calendar/calendar.js now`, append with timestamp
- NEVER use `date` for timestamp (UTC, not Pacific)

## Bills (household/bills.md)

Format: `- [ ] Bill Name | $Amount | Due: YYYY-MM-DD`
Paid: `- [x] Bill Name | $Amount | Due: YYYY-MM-DD | Paid: YYYY-MM-DD`

- **Query upcoming:** Filter unpaid (`- [ ]`), compare due date to today (from `node calendar/calendar.js now`)

## Meals (household/meals/this-week.md)

Format: `- Day: Meal description` (all 7 days, Monday-Sunday)

- **"What's for dinner?"** Get today's day name from `node calendar/calendar.js now`, find matching line

## Response Style

- Confirm actions: "Added! ✅", "Done! 📅"
- Use emojis: 📅 🛒 ✅ 📝 🏠
- Times in Pacific with AM/PM
- No markdown tables in Telegram -- use bullet lists
```

Keep it under 100 lines. Every instruction must be self-contained (don't say "see TOOLS.md for details"). The whole point is that a cheap LLM can use ONLY this file and handle the most common requests correctly.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Confirm QUICKSTART.md exists at workspace root.
    Count lines -- should be under 100.
    Grep for "node calendar/calendar.js now" -- must appear (timezone rule).
    Grep for "NEVER" -- should appear at least twice (timezone warnings).
    Grep for "household/" -- should appear for each file reference.
    Confirm all 5 operations covered: calendar, todos, shopping, notes, bills.
  </verify>
  <done>
    QUICKSTART.md exists at workspace root, is under 100 lines, and covers all 5 common operations with exact commands. Timezone rule is stated inline. A cheap LLM reading ONLY this file would handle "what's today", "add milk to shopping", "note: plumber called", and "add event dentist tomorrow at 2pm" correctly.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Cross-reference AGENTS.md and TOOLS.md to mention QUICKSTART.md</name>
  <files>AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md</files>
  <action>
Read AGENTS.md and add a note in the startup checklist (after Step 4 or as a note) that QUICKSTART.md exists as a condensed reference:

In the startup checklist, add after Step 4 (Load tools reference):
```
**Tip:** If context budget is tight, `/QUICKSTART.md` has the essential commands on one page. Still read TOOLS.md when you need full details or edge cases.
```

Read TOOLS.md and add a note at the very top (after the title, before Workspace Location):
```
> **Quick reference:** See `QUICKSTART.md` for a condensed single-page command reference.
```

These are small additions -- do not restructure either file. Just add the cross-references.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Grep AGENTS.md for "QUICKSTART" -- should appear at least once.
    Grep TOOLS.md for "QUICKSTART" -- should appear at least once.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Both AGENTS.md and TOOLS.md reference QUICKSTART.md. An LLM reading either file knows the quickstart exists as a fallback. The cross-references are brief and don't disrupt the existing document structure.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. QUICKSTART.md exists at workspace root
2. Under 100 lines
3. Covers: calendar, todos, shopping, notes, bills, meals
4. Timezone rule stated inline with exact command
5. "NEVER use date" warning present
6. AGENTS.md and TOOLS.md both reference QUICKSTART.md
7. All commands in QUICKSTART.md are consistent with the updated TOOLS.md
</verification>

<success_criteria>
A cheap LLM loaded with ONLY QUICKSTART.md (nothing else) can:
- Correctly respond to "what's today" by running `node calendar/calendar.js today`
- Add a shopping item in the correct format
- Add a note with Pacific timestamp (not UTC)
- Know bills.md uses pipe-separated format
- Know meals are organized by day name (Monday-Sunday)
The file fits in a single screen/page and requires zero cross-referencing.
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-instruction-hardening/01-03-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
