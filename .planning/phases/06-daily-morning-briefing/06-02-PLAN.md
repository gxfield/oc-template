<objective>
Add automated morning briefing references to QUICKSTART.md and AGENTS.md so cheap LLMs discover the feature from condensed references.

Purpose: Agents need to know the morning briefing automation exists from both the quick reference and the startup checklist. This follows the same pattern used for Quick Capture, Meal Planning, and on-demand Briefing.

Output: Updated QUICKSTART.md with automated briefing note, updated AGENTS.md with morning briefing awareness.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add automated morning briefing note to QUICKSTART.md</name>
  <files>QUICKSTART.md</files>
  <action>
Add a brief "Automated Morning Briefing" note within the existing Briefing section of QUICKSTART.md (after the "Empty states" line at line 97, before the "## Response Style" section at line 99).

Add 4-5 lines covering:
- During heartbeat polls between 7-10 AM Pacific, send a briefing automatically
- Check `memory/heartbeat-state.json` `lastMorningBriefing` to avoid duplicates
- Same format and data sources as on-demand briefing
- See TOOLS.md Briefing section for full details

Keep it concise (this is a quick reference). Target: QUICKSTART.md stays under 115 lines total.

Follow the established pattern: condensed reference with key rules, no full examples.
  </action>
  <verify>Read QUICKSTART.md and confirm: automated morning briefing note exists in Briefing section, mentions 7-10 AM window, mentions heartbeat-state.json dedup, total file is under 115 lines</verify>
  <done>QUICKSTART.md Briefing section includes automated morning briefing note with timing and dedup reference, file under 115 lines</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add automated morning briefing mention to AGENTS.md</name>
  <files>AGENTS.md</files>
  <action>
Add a brief mention of the automated morning briefing to the AGENTS.md startup checklist. Two changes:

1. In Step 4 (after the existing Briefing tip at line 34), add one line:
   `- **Automated Morning Briefing:** During heartbeat polls 7-10 AM Pacific, send the briefing automatically if not already sent today. See HEARTBEAT.md for task and TOOLS.md Briefing section for format.`

2. In the Heartbeat section "Things to check" list (around line 184-189), add or update to include:
   `- **Morning briefing** - If 7-10 AM Pacific and not sent today, send household briefing (see HEARTBEAT.md)`

Follow the existing patterns exactly: same indentation, same style, same level of detail as Quick Capture and Meal Planning mentions.
  </action>
  <verify>Read AGENTS.md and confirm: Step 4 has automated morning briefing mention after the Briefing tip, heartbeat section mentions morning briefing check</verify>
  <done>AGENTS.md Step 4 mentions automated morning briefing, heartbeat section includes morning briefing in the things-to-check list</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- QUICKSTART.md Briefing section includes automated morning briefing note
- AGENTS.md Step 4 mentions automated morning briefing with HEARTBEAT.md reference
- AGENTS.md heartbeat section includes morning briefing in periodic checks
- Both files follow established patterns from prior phases
- QUICKSTART.md stays under 115 lines
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- A cheap LLM reading QUICKSTART.md would learn that morning briefings are automated during 7-10 AM heartbeats
- An agent following the AGENTS.md startup checklist would know about the automated morning briefing feature
- File sizes remain reasonable for cheap LLM context windows
</success_criteria>
