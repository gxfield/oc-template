<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add Briefing section to QUICKSTART.md</name>
  <files>QUICKSTART.md</files>
  <action>
Add a "## Briefing" section to QUICKSTART.md. Place it after the Quick Capture section and before the Response Style section (following the logical flow: Calendar -> Todos -> Shopping -> Notes -> Bills -> Meals -> Quick Capture -> **Briefing** -> Response Style).

The Briefing section should be concise (matching QUICKSTART.md's condensed style) and include:

1. Trigger phrases: "briefing", "status", "house status", "catch me up"
2. Data sources list (5 items): calendar today, pending todos, shopping list, tonight's meal, bills due in 7 days
3. Output format rule: Emoji headers + bullet lists. No markdown tables.
4. Key commands to run:
   - `node calendar/calendar.js today` for events
   - `node calendar/calendar.js now` for today's date (meal lookup + bill date comparison)
5. Empty-state rule: Show all 5 sections even if empty, use friendly empty messages

Keep it under 15 lines total. This is a quick reference -- full details are in TOOLS.md.

Target total file size: under 110 lines (currently 89 lines, adding ~15 for briefing).

  <files>AGENTS.md</files>
  <action>
In AGENTS.md Step 4 ("Load tools reference"), add a briefing tip after the existing Meal Planning line. Follow the same pattern:

Current Step 4 has:
```
- **Quick Capture:** Users can say "remember X", "we need X", or "todo X" for fast capture. See TOOLS.md Quick Capture section for full trigger list.
- **Meal Planning:** Users can set weekly dinners, ask "what's for dinner", and generate shopping lists from meals. See TOOLS.md Meal Planning section for triggers and examples.
```

Add after the Meal Planning line:
```
- **Briefing:** Users can say "briefing" or "status" to get a combined household summary (calendar, todos, shopping, meals, bills). See TOOLS.md Briefing section for output format and assembly steps.
```

This is a single line addition.
