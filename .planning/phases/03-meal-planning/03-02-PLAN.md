<objective>
Expand QUICKSTART.md Meals section and add meal planning mention to AGENTS.md startup checklist.

Purpose: Ensure cheap LLMs have a condensed reference for meal planning commands in QUICKSTART.md (the single-page quick reference) and are prompted to be aware of meal planning during session startup via AGENTS.md. Follows the same pattern as Phase 02-02 which added Quick Capture to both files.

Output: Expanded QUICKSTART.md Meals section; updated AGENTS.md Step 4.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Expand Meals section in QUICKSTART.md</name>
  <files>QUICKSTART.md</files>
  <action>
Expand the existing Meals section in QUICKSTART.md (currently lines 59-63, just 5 lines). The current content is:

```
## Meals (household/meals/this-week.md)

Format: `- Day: Meal description` (all 7 days, Monday-Sunday)

- **"What's for dinner?"** Get today's day name from `node calendar/calendar.js now`, find matching line
```

Replace with an expanded version that covers all three meal planning capabilities. Keep it condensed (QUICKSTART.md must stay under ~100 lines total). Use the same terse style as other QUICKSTART sections.

New Meals section content:

```
## Meals (household/meals/this-week.md)

Format: `- Day: Meal description` (all 7 days, Monday-Sunday)

- **"What's for dinner?"** Get today's day from `node calendar/calendar.js now`, find matching line
- **"What's for dinner tomorrow?"** Get today, compute next day, find matching line
- **Set meal:** Read file, replace `- Day: ...` line, write back. Keep all 7 days.
- **Set no day given:** "set dinner to pizza" = assume tonight
- **Shopping from meals:** Read planned meals, propose ingredient list, ask before adding to shopping.md
- Do NOT auto-add ingredients -- always confirm with user first
```

Make sure QUICKSTART.md stays under 100 lines total. If expanding Meals pushes it over, tighten wording in the new lines (not other sections).
  </action>
  <verify>
Verify in QUICKSTART.md:
- Meals section has "set meal" instruction
- Meals section has "shopping from meals" instruction
- Meals section references `node calendar/calendar.js now` for day lookup
- Total file length is under 100 lines
- All other sections are unchanged
  </verify>
  <done>QUICKSTART.md Meals section covers set, query, and shopping-from-meals in condensed format, and total file stays under 100 lines.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add meal planning mention to AGENTS.md Step 4</name>
  <files>AGENTS.md</files>
  <action>
In AGENTS.md, Step 4 (Load tools reference, starting around line 29), there is already a Quick Capture tip:

```
- **Quick Capture:** Users can say "remember X", "we need X", or "todo X" for fast capture. See TOOLS.md Quick Capture section for full trigger list.
```

Add a similar line after the Quick Capture tip for Meal Planning:

```
- **Meal Planning:** Users can set weekly dinners, ask "what's for dinner", and generate shopping lists from meals. See TOOLS.md Meal Planning section for triggers and examples.
```

This ensures the agent is primed to recognize meal planning commands from the start of each session. Do not modify any other part of AGENTS.md.
  </action>
  <verify>
Verify in AGENTS.md:
- Step 4 contains a "Meal Planning:" bullet point
- The bullet mentions "what's for dinner" and "shopping lists from meals"
- It references "TOOLS.md Meal Planning section"
- No other changes to the file
  </verify>
  <done>AGENTS.md Step 4 mentions meal planning capability so agents are primed for meal commands at session start.</done>
</task>

Phase 03 Plan 02 verification:
1. QUICKSTART.md Meals section expanded with set/query/shopping-from-meals
2. QUICKSTART.md under 100 lines total
3. AGENTS.md Step 4 mentions Meal Planning
4. No other sections of either file were changed
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- QUICKSTART.md has expanded Meals section covering all three capabilities (set, query, shopping generation)
- QUICKSTART.md total length under 100 lines
- AGENTS.md Step 4 has Meal Planning tip bullet
- A cheap LLM loading AGENTS.md + QUICKSTART.md is primed and equipped for basic meal planning
</success_criteria>
