<objective>
Document local_config.json in agent instruction files so the LLM agent knows the config exists and can guide users on changing household defaults.

Purpose: Without documentation, the agent won't know to reference local_config.json when users ask about changing their city, timezone, or temperature units.
Output: Updated TOOLS.md and QUICKSTART.md with config references.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add local_config.json section to TOOLS.md</name>
  <files>TOOLS.md</files>
  <action>
Add a new section to TOOLS.md titled "## Household Configuration (local_config.json)".

Place it near the top of the file, after any introductory sections and before the first feature-specific section. This is a cross-cutting concern that affects multiple features.

Content should include:
- What it is: Central config file for household-specific defaults
- File location: `local_config.json` (workspace root)
- Fields table:

| Field | Purpose | Default | Used By |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|
| `city` | Default weather location | `Seattle,WA,US` | Weather task |
| `timezone` | Timezone for cache daily reset | `America/Los_Angeles` | Cache module |
| `units` | Temperature units (imperial/metric) | `imperial` | Weather task |

- Note: If file is missing, system uses built-in defaults (listed above)
- Note: Calendar timezone is separate -- managed in `calendar/config.json`

Keep it concise. No more than ~20 lines for the section. Follow the existing TOOLS.md format and style.
  </action>
  <verify>Grep TOOLS.md for "local_config.json" -- should find the new section.</verify>
  <done>TOOLS.md contains a Household Configuration section documenting local_config.json fields, defaults, and which modules use them.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add config reference to QUICKSTART.md</name>
  <files>QUICKSTART.md</files>
  <action>
Add a brief "## Household Config" section to QUICKSTART.md. Place it after the "Rule #1: Timezone" section and before "## Calendar" -- config context should come early since it affects weather defaults.

Content (keep under 8 lines):
```
## Household Config

Defaults live in `local_config.json` (workspace root):
- **City:** `Seattle,WA,US` (weather default)
- **Units:** `imperial` (Fahrenheit)
- **Timezone:** `America/Los_Angeles` (cache resets)

See TOOLS.md "Household Configuration" for details.
```

Do NOT expand QUICKSTART.md significantly -- it must stay under ~120 lines total for cheap LLM context efficiency (currently ~142 lines).
  </action>
  <verify>Grep QUICKSTART.md for "local_config.json" -- should find the new section. Count lines: `wc -l QUICKSTART.md` should be under 155.</verify>
  <done>QUICKSTART.md has a concise Household Config section referencing local_config.json with key defaults listed.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. `grep "local_config.json" TOOLS.md` -- returns match(es)
2. `grep "local_config.json" QUICKSTART.md` -- returns match(es)
3. `wc -l QUICKSTART.md` -- under 155 lines (QUICKSTART must stay compact)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- TOOLS.md has a Household Configuration section with field table
- QUICKSTART.md has a brief Household Config section with defaults
- Both files reference local_config.json by name
- QUICKSTART.md stays compact (under 155 lines)
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/03-local-config-json-to-store-household-specific-info-like-city-temperature/03-02-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
