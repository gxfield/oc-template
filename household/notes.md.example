<!-- FORMAT:
  Purpose: Quick household notes with timestamps
  Line format: "- [YYYY-MM-DD h:mm AM/PM PT] Note text"
  To add: Append "- [TIMESTAMP PT] Note text" at the end. Get current Pacific time from `node calendar.js now`.
  Rules:
    - Every note MUST have a Pacific timestamp
    - Timestamp format: YYYY-MM-DD h:mm AM/PM PT (e.g., 2026-02-09 10:30 PM PT)
    - Get time from `node calendar.js now`, NOT from `date` command (which returns UTC)
    - One note per line
    - Preserve all existing notes
  Example line: - [2026-02-09 10:30 PM PT] Plumber's number is 555-1234
