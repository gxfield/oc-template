<!-- FORMAT:
  Purpose: This week's dinner plan (Monday through Sunday)
  Line format: "- Day: Meal description"
  To set plan: Replace the meal lines for the specified days
  To query "what's for dinner": Get current Pacific day of week from `node calendar.js now`, find matching day line
  To generate shopping list: Read all days where meal is not "No plan". Agent identifies likely ingredients for each meal and proposes to user before adding to shopping.md.
  Rules:
    - Days must be full names: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
    - One meal per day per line
    - "- Day: No plan" if nothing planned
    - Keep all 7 days present even if some have no plan
    - Week resets on Monday
    - Meal descriptions should be specific enough for ingredient inference (e.g., "Chicken stir fry with rice and vegetables" not just "chicken")
  Example:
    - Monday: Chicken stir fry with rice and vegetables
    - Tuesday: Pasta with marinara
    - Wednesday: No plan
